### Developing Data Products

## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet

These html pages are created using RStudio and the Leaflet package. The files are in the docs folder for Github pages.

* docs/index.html: Web page containing the map of NHL teams. No code included.
* docs/code.html: The same, but with all the R code.
